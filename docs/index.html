	<h3>Utilities to fill gaps in the Java standard libraries</h3>
	<p>
		Checked exceptions are favored by many developers because of their type safety.

		One of the reasons many developers don't like checked exceptions is because
		of how painful they are to use in lambdas.

		By making some minor changes to common @FunctionalInterface classes,
		this pain point will be eliminated.

		If the language also adopts default values for generic parameters,
		then the classes will retain backwards-compatibility.
